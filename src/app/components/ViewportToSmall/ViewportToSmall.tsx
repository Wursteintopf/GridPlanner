        <p>
          It seems like you are using this website either in a very small window or on a device with a viewport
          smaller than 960 pixels. This page was developed to be used with regular desktop devices, not on smartphones.<br /><br />
          I might add mobile support in the future, I might not. If that annoys you, feel free to contribute to the
          public github repo, this is open source after all. <span role="img" aria-label="smile">ðŸ˜‰</span><br /><br />
          <LinkButton href={'http://github.com/Wursteintopf/GridPlanner'} >Open github <ArrowForwardIcon /></LinkButton><br /><br />
          If you dont care, you could still try to use the tool on mobile, but please proceed with caution. I dont know
          what happens if you do so and I won't take any responsibility if your device randomly explodes. <span role="img" aria-label="explosion">ðŸ’¥</span><br /><br />
          <Button onClick={() => dispatch(useOnSmallDevice())}>Stfu and proceed <ArrowForwardIcon /></Button>
